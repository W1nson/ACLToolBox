0,F8S005CJIsf,Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning and Fine-Grained Aggregation for Fact Checking,,,,,/pdf?id=F8S005CJIsf,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fact checking is a challenging task that requires corresponding evidences to verify the property of a claim based on reasoning. Previous studies generally i) construct the graph by treating each evidence-claim pair as node which is a simple way that ignores to exploit their implicit interaction, or building a fully-connected graph among claim and evidences where the entailment relationship between claim and evidence would be considered equally to the semantic relationship among evidences; ii) aggregate evidences equally without considering their different stances towards the verification of fact. Towards the above issues, we propose a novel heterogeneous-graph reasoning and fine-grained aggregation model, with two following modules: 1) a heterogeneous graph attention network module to distinguish different types of relationships within the constructed graph; 2) fine-grained aggregation module which learns the implicit stance of evidences towards the prediction result in details. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our proposed model achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods.",Anonymous,/forum?id=F8S005CJIsf

Cyber or online sexual grooming has been recognized as a serious cyber crime. However, there have been insufficient programs to proactively protect the youth from cybergrooming. In this work, we present a generative chatbot framework, called SERI (Stop cybERgroomIng), that can generate simulated conversations between a perpetrator chatbot and a potential victim chatbot. To realize the simulation of authentic conversations in the context of cybergrooming, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dialogue generation for authentic simulation of the conversations between a potential victim and a perpetrator (i.e., cybergroomer). The design of the SERI is motivated to ensure a safe and authentic environment to strengthen the youth's precautionary awareness of cybergrooming while any unnecessary ethical issues (e.g., the potential misuse of the SERI) are removed or minimized. We developed the SERI as a preliminary platform that can deploy the perpetrator chatbot to interact with human users (i.e., youth) to observe youth users' responses to strangers or acquaintances and collect the reactions when the youth users are asked for private or sensitive information by the perpetrator. We evaluated the quality of conversations generated by the SERI based on open-source, referenced, unreferenced metrics, and human evaluation.",Anonymous,/forum?id=15ZiKr2oSkC

However, we have empirically found that decoding acceleration is fragile when using a large batch size and running on the CPU. We demonstrate that one-pass NAT is sufficient when providing a few target contexts in advance through synthetic experiments. Inspired by this, we propose a two-stage translation prototype -- Hybrid-Regressive Translation (HRT) to combine the strengths of autoregressive and non-autoregressive. Specifically, HRT first generates a discontinuous sequence by autoregression (e.g., make a prediction every k tokens, k>1) and then fills all previously skipped tokens at once in a non-autoregressive manner. We also propose a bag of techniques to effectively and efficiently train HRT, with almost no increase in parameters. Experimental results on WMT En-Ro, En-De, and NIST Zh-En show that our model outperforms existing semi-autoregressive models and is competitive with current state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models. Moreover, compared to its autoregressive counterpart, HRT has a stable 1.5x acceleration, regardless of batch size and device.",Anonymous,/forum?id=o6Cx94hha-b

Isolating Crucial Ingredients for Cross-lingual Transfer,,,,,/pdf?id=nWNq_AarEVd,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While recent work on multilingual language models has demonstrated their capacity for cross-lingual zero-shot transfer on downstream tasks, there is a lack of consensus in the community as to what shared properties between languages enable such transfer. Analyses involving pairs of natural languages are often inconclusive and contradictory since languages simultaneously differ in many linguistic aspects. In this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical study to isolate the effects of various linguistic properties by measuring zero-shot transfer between four diverse natural languages and their counterparts constructed by modifying aspects such as the script, word order, and syntax. Among other things, our experiments show that the absence of sub-word overlap significantly affects zero-shot transfer when languages differ in their word order, and there is a strong correlation between transfer performance and word embedding alignment between languages (e.g., œÅs=0.94 on the task of NLI). Our results call for focus in multilingual models on explicitly improving word embedding alignment between languages rather than relying on its implicit emergence.",Anonymous,/forum?id=nWNq_AarEVd

However, most existing compressive summarisation methods are supervised, relying on the expensive effort of creating a new training dataset with corresponding compressive summaries. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised compressive summarisation method that utilises reinforcement learning to optimise a summary's semantic coverage and fluency by simulating human judgment on summarisation quality. Our model consists of an extractor agent and a compressor agent, and both agents have a multi-head attentional pointer-based structure. The extractor agent first chooses salient sentences from a document, and then the compressor agent compresses these extracted sentences by selecting salient words to form a summary without using reference summaries to compute the summary reward. That is, a parallel dataset with document-summary pairs is not required to train the proposed model. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first work on unsupervised compressive summarisation. Experimental results on three widely used datasets, Newsroom, CNN/DM, and XSum, show that our model achieves promising performance and significant improvement on Newsroom in terms of the ROUGE metric.",Anonymous,/forum?id=cTFOIyRjowo

In sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning, transformers are often unable to predict correct outputs for longer examples than those seen at training. This paper introduces iterative decoding, an alternative to seq2seq that (i) improves transformer compositional generalization in the PCFG and Cartesian product datasets and (ii) evidences that, in these datasets, seq2seq transformers do not learn iterations that are not unrolled. In iterative decoding, training examples are broken down into a sequence of intermediate steps that the transformer learns iteratively. At inference time, the intermediate outputs are fed back to the transformer as intermediate inputs until an end-of-iteration token is predicted. We conclude by illustrating some limitations of iterative decoding in the CFQ dataset.",Anonymous,/forum?id=Qf2p8Zx4Ej

In this paper, we focus on extracting event arguments from an entire document, which mainly faces two critical problems: a) the long-distance dependency between trigger and arguments over sentences; b) the distracting context towards an event in the document. To address these issues, we propose a \textbf{T}wo-\textbf{S}tream \textbf{A}bstract meaning \textbf{R}epresentation enhanced extraction model (TSAR). TSAR encodes the document from different perspectives by a two-stream encoding module, to utilize local and global information and lower the impact of distracting context. Besides, TSAR introduces an AMR-guided interaction module to capture both intra-sentential and inter-sentential features, based on the locally and globally constructed AMR semantic graphs. An auxiliary boundary loss is introduced to enhance the boundary information for text spans explicitly. Extensive experiments illustrate that TSAR outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, with 2.54 F1 and 5.13 F1 performance gain on the public RAMS and WikiEvents datasets respectively, showing the superiority in the cross-sentence arguments extraction.

Recent popular works tend to exploit syntactic information guiding sentiment dependency parsing, i.e., structure-based sentiment dependency learning. However, many works fall into the trap that confusing the concepts between syntax dependency and sentiment dependency. Besides, structure information (e.g., syntactic dependency tree) usually consumes expensive computational resources due to the extraction of the adjacent matrix. Instead, we believe the sentiment dependency mostly occurs between adjacent aspects. By proposing the sentiment patterns (SP) to boost the sentiment dependency learning, we introduce the Local dependency aggregating (Lena) to explore sentiment dependency in the text. Experiments show that Lena is more efficient than existing structure-based models without dependency matrix constructing and modeling expense. The performance on all five public ABSC datasets makes a big step compared to state-of-the-art models, and our work could inspire future research focusing on efficient local sentient dependency modeling.",Anonymous,/forum?id=L3TcOq4D2cD

12,6Lf2H-Bx59N,Anticipation-free Training for Simultaneous Translation,,,,,/pdf?id=6Lf2H-Bx59N,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Simultaneous translation (SimulMT) speeds up the translation process by starting to translate before the source sentence is completely available. It is difficult due to limited context and word order difference between languages. Existing methods increase latency or introduce adaptive read-write policies for SimulMT models to handle local reordering and improve translation quality. However, the long-distance reordering would make the SimulMT models learn translation mistakenly. Specifically, the model may be forced to predict target tokens when the corresponding source tokens have not been read. This leads to aggressive anticipation during inference, resulting in the hallucination phenomenon. To mitigate this problem, we propose a new framework that decompose the translation process into the monotonic translation step and the reordering step, and we model the latter by the auxiliary sorting network (ASN). The ASN rearranges the hidden states to match the order in the target language, so that the SimulMT model could learn to translate more reasonably. The entire model is optimized end-to-end and does not rely on external aligners or data. During inference, ASN is removed to achieve streaming.

In this paper, we overcome this problem by considering multiple simple rankers for better approximating the black box ranking model. We pose the problem of local approximation as a Generalized Preference Coverage (GPC) problem that incorporates multiple simple rankers towards the post-hoc interpretability of ranking models. Our approach Multiplex uses a linear programming approach to judiciously extract the explanation terms.

We present a systematic comparison of sequence-to-sequence models and models guided by compositional principles on the recent COGS corpus (Kim and Linzen, 2020). Though seq2seq models can perform well on lexical tasks, they perform with near-zero accuracy on structural generalization tasks that require novel syntactic structures; this holds true even when they are trained to predict syntax instead of semantics. In contrast, compositional models achieve near-perfect accuracy on structural generalization; we present new results confirming this from the AM parser (Groschwitz et al., 2021). Our findings show structural generalization is a key measure of compositional generalization and requires models that are aware of complex structure.",Anonymous,/forum?id=U-37qbGWEN4

With the detrimental effects of these algorithmic biases, researchers proposed promising approaches for bias mitigation, typically designed for individual bias types. Due to the complex nature of social bias, we argue it is important to study how different biases interact with each other, i.e., how mitigating one bias type (e.g., gender) influences the bias results regarding other social identities (e.g., race and religion). We further question whether jointly debiasing multiple types of bias is desired in different contexts, e.g., when correlations between biases are different. To address these research questions, we examine bias mitigation in two NLP tasks -- toxicity detection and word embeddings -- on three social identities, i.e., race, gender, and religion.

When we execute such a paradigm on continuously sequential tasks, the model will suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem (i.e., they forget the parameters learned in previous tasks when we train the model on newly emerged tasks). Inspired by the idea of how humans learn things, we aim to maintain the old knowledge when we transfer to novel contents and calibrate the old and new knowledge. We propose a Logits and Parameter Calibration (LPC) framework to reduce the catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning process. The proposed framework includes two important components, the Logits Calibration (LC) and Parameter Calibration (PC). The core idea is to reduce the difference between old knowledge and new knowledge by doing calibration on logits and parameters so that the model can maintain old knowledge while learning new tasks without preserving data in previous tasks. First, we preserve the parameters learned from the base tasks. Second, we train the existing model on novel tasks and estimate the difference between base logits and parameters and novel logits and parameters. Third, we drift from the base tasks to novel tasks gradually. Furthermore, we integrate the logtis and parameter calibration into a brand-new optimization algorithm.

Firstly, we discover that the success of magnitude pruning can be attributed to the preserved pre-training performance, which correlates with the downstream transferability. Inspired by this, we propose to directly optimize the subnetwork structure towards the pre-training objectives, which can better preserve the pre-training performance. Specifically, we train binary masks over model weights on the pre-training tasks, with the aim of preserving the universal transferability of the subnetwork, which is agnostic to any specific downstream tasks. We then fine-tune the subnetworks on the GLUE benchmark and the SQuAD dataset. The results show that, compared with magnitude pruning, mask training can effectively find BERT subnetworks with improved overall performance on downstream tasks.

We hypothesise that these problems hinder the ability of transformer-based models to handle complex words, and suggest that these problems are a result of allowing tokens to include spaces. We thus experiment with an alternative tokenisation approach where spaces are always treated as individual tokens, finding it alleviates existing problems, improving performance of models. Concretely, we apply a modification to the BPE and Unigram algorithms which implements this approach, and find it gives more morphologically correct tokenisations, in particular when handling prefixes. In addition, we show that the modified algorithms give improved performance on downstream NLP tasks that involve handling complex words, whilst having no detrimental effect on performance in general natural language understanding tasks.

However, the resulting ranking of models can also be unstable and highly sensitive to the choice of adversary model used. Moreover, AFLite oversamples examples with low annotator agreement, meaning that model comparisons hinge on the most contentiously labeled examples.

An evaluation on several corpora of cause--effect statements (heuristically and professionally labeled) yields about 60\%~recall at over 90\%~precision, outperforming state-of-the-art vocabulary-based approaches and performing on par with BERT while being less resource-demanding. A new resource of over 4~million health-related cause--effect statements is compiled, such as ``Studies show that stress induces insomnia.'', which explicitly connect symptoms (`stress') as claimed causes for conditions (`insomnia'). It consists of over 4~million sentences from more than 2~million unique web pages and 234,000 unique websites.",Anonymous,/forum?id=W7Po4NhFicq
63,dK5m9SY90_W,Non-Autoregressive Machine Translation: It's Not as Fast as it Seems,,,,,/pdf?id=dK5m9SY90_W,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Efficient machine translation models are commercially important as they can increase inference speeds, and reduce costs and carbon emissions. Recently, there has been much interest in non-autoregressive (NAR) models, which promise faster translation. In parallel to the research on NAR models, there have been successful attempts to create optimized autoregressive models as part of the WMT shared task on efficient translation. In this paper, we point out flaws in the evaluation methodology present in the literature on NAR models and we provide fair comparison between a state-of-the-art NAR model and the autoregressive submissions to the shared task. We make the case for consistent evaluation of NAR models, and also for the importance of comparing NAR models with other widely used efficiency approaches. We run experiments with a connectionist-temporal-classification-based (CTC) NAR model implemented in C++ and compare it with AR models using wall clock times. Our results show that, although NAR models are faster on GPUs, with small batch sizes, they are nearly always slower under more realistic usage conditions. We call for more realistic and extensive evaluation of NAR models in future work.",Anonymous,/forum?id=dK5m9SY90_W
64,sYkhFm2kkzj,Challenging America: Modeling language in longer time scales,,,,,/pdf?id=sYkhFm2kkzj,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The aim of the paper is to apply, for historical texts, the methodology used commonly to solve various NLP tasks defined for contemporary data, i.e. pre-train and fine-tune large Transformer models. This paper introduces an ML challenge, named Challenging America (ChallAm), based on OCR-ed excerpts from historical newspapers collected from the Chronicling America portal. ChallAm provides a dataset of clippings, labeled with metadata on their origin, and paired with their textual contents retrieved by an OCR tool. Three, publicly available, ML tasks are defined in the challenge: to determine the article date, to detect the location of the issue, and to deduce a word in a text gap (cloze test). Strong baselines are provided for all three ChallAm tasks. In particular, we pre-trained a RoBERTa model from scratch from the historical texts. We also discuss the issues of discrimination and hate-speech present in the historical American texts.",Anonymous,/forum?id=sYkhFm2kkzj
65,zPFbyqOX8Cx,Cloze Evaluation for Deeper Understanding of Commonsense Stories in Indonesian,,,,,/pdf?id=zPFbyqOX8Cx,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Story comprehension that involves complex causal and temporal relations is imperative in NLP, but previous studies have focused on English, leaving open the question of how the findings generalize to other languages, such as Indonesian. In this paper, we follow the Story Cloze Test framework of Mostafazadeh et al. (2016) in evaluating story understanding in Indonesian, by constructing a four-sentence story with one correct ending and one incorrect ending. To investigate commonsense knowledge acquisition in language models, we experimented with: (1) a classification task to predict the correct ending; and (2) a generation task to complete the story with a single sentence. We investigate these tasks in two settings: (i) monolingual training and (ii) zero-shot cross-lingual transfer between Indonesian and English.",Anonymous,/forum?id=zPFbyqOX8Cx
66,RfVMLYiA7Ed,TASA: Twin Answer Sentences Attack for Adversarial Context Generation in Question Answering,,,,,/pdf?id=RfVMLYiA7Ed,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We present Twin Answer Sentences Attack (TASA), a novel question answering (QA) adversarial attack method that produces fluent and grammatical adversarial contexts while maintaining its gold answers. Despite phenomenal progresses on general adversarial attacks, few works have investigated the vulnerability and adversarial attack specifically for QA. In this work, we first investigate the biases in the existing models and discover that they heavily rely on keyword matching and ignore the relevant entities from the question. TASA explores the two biases above and attacks the target model in two folds: (1) lowering the model's confidence on the gold answer with a perturbed answer sentence; (2) misguiding the model towards a wrong answer with a distracting answer sentence. Equipped with designed beam search and filtering methods, TASA is able to attack the target model efficiently while sustaining the quality of contexts. Extensive experiments on four QA datasets and human evaluations demonstrate that TASA generates substantial-high-quality attacks than existing textual adversarial attack methods.",Anonymous,/forum?id=RfVMLYiA7Ed
67,4OFAG-W2Mi6,Diagnosing Vision-and-Language Navigation: What Really Matters,,,,,/pdf?id=4OFAG-W2Mi6,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a multimodal task where an agent follows natural language instructions and navigates in visual environments. Multiple setups have been proposed, and researchers apply new model architectures or training techniques to boost navigation performance. However, there still exist non-negligible gaps between machines' performance and human benchmarks. Moreover, the agents' inner mechanisms for navigation decisions remain unclear. To the best of our knowledge, how the agents perceive the multimodal input is under-studied and needs investigation. In this work, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments to unveil agents' focus during navigation. Results show that indoor navigation agents refer to both object and direction tokens when making decisions. In contrast, outdoor navigation agents heavily rely on direction tokens and poorly understand the object tokens. The differences in dataset designs and the visual features lead to distinct behaviors on visual environment understanding. Many models claim that they can align object tokens with specific visual targets when it comes to vision-and-language alignments. We find unbalanced attention on the vision and text input and doubt the reliability of such cross-modal alignments.",Anonymous,/forum?id=4OFAG-W2Mi6
