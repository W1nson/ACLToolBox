0,_652yz79V9g,Multimodal Learning: Are Captions All You Need?,,,,,/pdf?id=_652yz79V9g,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In today's digital world, it is increasingly common for information to be multimodal: images or videos often accompany text. Sophisticated multimodal architectures such as ViLBERT, VisualBERT, and LXMERT have achieved state-of-the-art performance in vision-and-language tasks. However, existing vision models cannot represent contextual information and semantics like transformer-based language models can. Fusing the semantic-rich information coming from text becomes a challenge. In this work, we study the alternative of first transforming images into text using image captioning. We then use transformer-based methods to combine the two modalities in a simple but effective way. We perform an empirical analysis on different multimodal tasks, describing the benefits, limitations, and situations where this simple approach can replace large and expensive handcrafted multimodal models.",Anonymous,/forum?id=_652yz79V9g,,,,,
1,lMQ2TTkQo51,Sparsity Regularization for Chinese Spelling Check,,,,,/pdf?id=lMQ2TTkQo51,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Chinese Spelling Check (CSC) research objective is to detect and correct the spelling errors in the input. Generally, the number of incorrect characters in the input is far less than the correct, so the error probability sequence of input sentence predicted by the detection module should be sparse and sharp. However, all existing work has ignored this problem. In this paper, we add a sparsity regularization item to the objective function to make the output of the detection module close to sparse and sharp. We study two kinds of regularization: L1 regularization and minimum entropy regularization. Extensive experiments on the SIGHAN show that the sparsity regularization proposed in this paper can effectively improve the performance of the CSC model while without increasing the computational complexity. In addition, the robustness experiment results show that our method is robust.",Anonymous,/forum?id=lMQ2TTkQo51,,,,,
2,_WRoowuSImQ,Perturbation-based Self-supervised Attention for Text Classification,,,,,/pdf?id=_WRoowuSImQ,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For text classification, the traditional attention mechanism usually pays too much attention to words that appear frequently and needs a lot of labeled data for learning a good distribution. Introducing human attention is a classical method, but it needs a high cost of manual labeling. This paper proposes a perturbation-based self-supervised attention approach to guide attention learning without any annotation overheads. Specifically, we add as much noise as possible to all the words in the sentence simultaneously while without changing their semantics and predictions. According to the words that tolerate more noise are supposed to be less significant, we can obtain attention supervision information and utilize it to refine the attention distribution. Experimental results on three text classification tasks show that our approach can significantly promote the performance of current attention-based models and is more effective than existing self-supervised methods. We also provide visualization analysis to verify the effectiveness of our approach.",Anonymous,/forum?id=_WRoowuSImQ,,,,,
3,0XOfocEp0u2,A Generative Approach for Mitigating Structural Biases in Natural Language Inference,,,,,/pdf?id=0XOfocEp0u2,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many natural language inference (NLI) datasets contain biases that allow models to perform well by only using a biased subset of the input, without considering the remainder features. For instance, models are able to classify samples by only using the hypothesis, without learning the true relationship between it and the premise. These structural biases lead discriminative models to learn unintended superficial features and generalize poorly out of the training distribution. In this work, we reformulate the NLI task as a generative task, where a model is conditioned on the biased subset of the input and the label and generates the remaining subset of the input. We show that by imposing a uniform prior, we obtain a provably unbiased model. Through synthetic experiments, we find that this approach is highly robust to large amounts of bias. We then demonstrate empirically on two types of natural bias that this approach leads to fully unbiased models in practice. However, we find that generative models are difficult to train and generally perform worse than discriminative baselines. We highlight the difficulty of the generative modeling task in the context of NLI as a cause for this worse performance. Finally, by fine-tuning the generative model with a discriminative objective, we reduce the performance gap between the generative model and the discriminative baseline, while allowing for a small amount of bias.",Anonymous,/forum?id=0XOfocEp0u2,/attachment?id=0XOfocEp0u2&name=data,/attachment?id=0XOfocEp0u2&name=software,,,

These biases may directly or indirectly harm people, therefore previous studies have focused only on human attributes. If the social biases in NLP models can be indirectly harmful to humans involved, then the models can also indirectly harm nonhuman animals. However, no research on social biases in NLP regarding nonhumans exists. In this paper, we analyze biases to nonhuman animals, i.e. speciesist bias, inherent in English Masked Language Models. We analyze this bias using template-based and corpus-extracted sentences which contain speciesist (or non-speciesist) language, to show that these models tend to associate harmful words with nonhuman animals.

Under the trend of deep learning, this paper choose the powerful bert network architecture and propose Pinyin-bert to solve the P2C task, which achieves substantial performance improvement from Ngram model.

The model yields higher posterior probabilities for the same attributes that humans deem relevant in metaphoric utterances over erroneous ones in 89% of all cases, validating the use of word vectors to generate prior probabilities in an RSA framework.

Current unsupervised approaches rely on learning structure preserving linear transformations using adversarial networks and refinement strategies. However, such techniques, tend to suffer from instability and convergence issues, requiring tedious fine-tuning of parameter setting. This paper proposes BioSpere, a novel multi-stage framework for unsupervised mapping of bi-lingual word embeddings onto a shared vector space, by combining adversarial initialization, refinement procedure and point set registration algorithm. We show that our framework alleviates the above shortcomings, and is robust against variable adversarial learning performance and parameter choices.

They are often deprived of the opportunity to participate in social activities due to their difficulty in understanding or using natural language. In this regard, Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a practical means of communication for children with language disabilities. In this study, we propose PicTalky, which is an AI-based AAC system that helps children with language developmental disabilities to improve their communication skills and language comprehension abilities. PicTalky can process both text and pictograms more accurately by connecting a series of neural-based NLP modules. Moreover, we perform quantitative and qualitative analyses on the essential features of PicTalky. It is expected that those suffering from language problems will be able to express their intentions or desires more easily and improve their quality of life by using this service.

9,1R5ZctTSwX-,Relation Extraction from Tables using Artificially Generated Metadata,,,,,/pdf?id=1R5ZctTSwX-,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Relation Extraction (RE) from tables is the task of identifying relations between pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated artificially from a Knowledge Graph (KG), which makes the cost to acquire them much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables, these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers, captions, etc; this is because synthetic tables are created out of KGs that do not store such metadata. Meanwhile, previous works have shown that metadata is important for accurate RE from tables. To address this issue, we propose methods to artificially create some of this metadata for synthetic tables. Afterward, we experiment with a BERT-based model, in line with recently published works, that takes as input a combination of proposed artificial metadata and table content. Our empirical results show that this leads to improvements of 9\%-45\% in F1 score, in absolute terms, over 2 tabular datasets.",Anonymous,/forum?id=1R5ZctTSwX-,,,,,

It has been argued that this is an inherent limitation of dense models. We disprove this claim by introducing the Salient Phrase Aware Retriever (SPAR), a dense retriever with the lexical matching capacity of a sparse model. In particular, we show that a dense retriever Λ can be trained to imitate a sparse one, and SPAR is built by augmenting a standard dense retriever with Λ. When evaluated on five open-domain question answering datasets and the MS MARCO passage retrieval task, SPAR sets a new state of the art for dense and sparse retrievers and can match or exceed the performance of more complicated dense-sparse hybrid systems.",Anonymous,/forum?id=bkagwUGBYU1,,,,,
11,ZCmUqcIjuGc,SHCT: A Successively Hierarchical Conditional Transformer for Controllable Paraphrase Generation,,,,,/pdf?id=ZCmUqcIjuGc,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Paraphrase generation has consistently been a challenging area in the field of NLP. Despite the considerable achievements made by previous work, existing methods lack a flexible way to include multiple controllable attributes to enhance the diversity of paraphrased sentences. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Successively Hierarchical Conditional Transformer(SHCT) to tackle this task. SHCT is based on a combination of Conditional Variational AutoEncoder(CVAE) with Transformer framework to benefit from the advantage of generating diversified words. More specifically, our SHCT deploys multi-head attention and dynamic memory mechanism to keep the interaction between each of the attributes and the corresponding encoder layer hidden state. To address the problem of absorbing flexible attributes, we apply a hierarchical structure to our SHCT which enables the framework to couple the CVAE latent variables with encoder layer hidden states successively. In addition, Our SHCT is trained by minimizing a tailor-designed loss for producing paraphrased sentences as required. Finally, We conduct extensive experiments to substantiate the validity and effectiveness of our proposed model. The results show that SHCT significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches and generates more diverse paraphrased sentences.",Anonymous,/forum?id=ZCmUqcIjuGc,,,,,

Our proposed inference technique jointly considers alignment and token probabilities in a principled manner and can be seamlessly integrated within existing constrained beam-search decoding algorithms.

13,lPx3fzsTTrK,Learning to Teach with Student Feedback,,,,,/pdf?id=lPx3fzsTTrK,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Knowledge distillation (KD) has gained much attention due to its effectiveness in compressing large-scale pre-trained models. In typical KD methods, the small student model is trained to match the soft targets generated by the big teacher model. However, the interaction between student and teacher is one-way. The teacher is usually fixed once trained, resulting in static soft targets to be distilled. This one-way interaction leads to the teacher's inability to perceive the characteristics of the student and its training progress. To address this issue, we propose Interactive Knowledge Distillation (IKD), which also allows the teacher to learn to teach from the feedback of the student. In particular, IKD trains the teacher model to generate specific soft target at each training step for a certain student. Joint optimization for both teacher and student is achieved by two iterative steps: a course step to optimize student with the soft target of teacher, and an exam step to optimize teacher with the feedback of student. IKD is a general framework that is orthogonal to most existing knowledge distillation methods. Experimental results show that IKD outperforms traditional KD methods on various NLP tasks.",Anonymous,/forum?id=lPx3fzsTTrK,,,,,

One of the downstream application is automatic questionnaire filling, where the content of the dialog is used to automatically fill a pre-defined medical questionnaire. Answering questions from the dialog context can be cast as a Natural Language Inference (NLI) task and therefore benefit from current pre-trained NLI models. However, these models have not been generally trained on dialog input format, which may have an influence on their performance. In this paper, we study the influence of dialog input format on the task.

15,2E1CRNtZP6t,On Isotropy Calibration of Transformer Models,,,,,/pdf?id=2E1CRNtZP6t,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Different studies of the embedding space of transformer models suggest that the distribution of contextual representations is highly anisotropic - the embeddings are distributed in a narrow cone. Meanwhile, static word representations (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe) have been shown to benefit from isotropic spaces. Therefore, previous work has developed methods to calibrate the embedding space of transformers in order to ensure isotropy. However, a recent study (Cai et al. 2021) shows that the embedding space of transformers is locally isotropic, which suggests that these models are already capable of exploiting the expressive capacity of their embedding space. In this work, we conduct an empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for isotropy calibration on transformers and find that they do not provide consistent improvements across models and tasks. These results support the thesis that, given the local isotropy, transformers do not benefit from additional isotropy calibration.",Anonymous,/forum?id=2E1CRNtZP6t,,,,,

Because good data is essential to obtain the best output of any system, we focused on validating our labeled data. Our results on static and real-time data have an accuracy of, respectively, 90% and 94%. Our labeled data validation allows us to correct labels; we also realized the need to increase the number of sets in our lexicons.

To address these limitations, we model entity alignment as a sequential decision-making task, in which an agent sequentially decides whether two entities are matched or mismatched based on their representation vectors.

Furthermore, given parallel translation pairs, previous contrastive learning frameworks can not well balance the monolingual embeddings’ alignment and uniformity which represent the quality of embeddings. In this paper, we build on the top of dual encoder and propose to freeze the source language encoder, utilizing its consistent embeddings to supervise the target language encoder via contrastive learning, where source-target translation pairs are regarded as positives. We provide the first exploration of utilizing parallel translation sentence pairs to learn universal sentence embeddings and show superior performance to balance the alignment and uniformity.

The softmax layer produces the distribution based on the dot products of a single hidden state and the embeddings of words in the vocabulary. However, we discover that this single hidden state cannot produce all probability distributions regardless of the LM size or training data size because the single hidden state embedding cannot be close to the embeddings of all the possible next words simultaneously when there are other interfering word embeddings between them. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of this limitation both theoretically and practically. Our work not only deepens our understanding of softmax bottleneck and mixture of softmax (MoS) but also inspires us to propose multi-facet softmax (MFS) to address the limitations of MoS. Extensive empirical analyses confirm our findings and show that against MoS, the proposed MFS achieves two-fold improvements in the perplexity of GPT-2 and BERT.",Anonymous,/forum?id=sagXUkJ1fDn,,/attachment?id=sagXUkJ1fDn&name=software,,,

For this reason, in this paper we propose fine-tuning an MDS baseline with a reward that balances a reference-based metric such as ROUGE with coverage of the input documents. To implement the approach, we utilize RELAX (Grathwohl et al., 2018), a contemporary gradient estimator which is both low-variance and unbiased, and we fine-tune the baseline in a few-shot style for both stability and computational efficiency. Experimental results over the Multi-News and WCEP MDS datasets show significant improvements of up to +0.95 pp average ROUGE score and +3.17 pp METEOR score over the baseline, and competitive results with the literature.

To overcome this confound, we probe grammatical role representation in BERT and GPT-2 on non-prototypical instances. Such instances are naturally occurring sentences with inanimate subjects or animate objects, or sentences where we systematically swap the arguments to make sentences like ""The onion cut the chef"". We find that, while early layer embeddings are largely lexical, word order is in fact crucial in defining the later-layer representations of words in semantically non-prototypical positions.

Still, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance in several end applications. In contrast to these models, we compute coherence on the basis of entities by constraining the input to noun phrases and proper names. This provides us with an explicit representation of the most important items in sentences leading to the notion of focus. This brings our model linguistically in line with pre-neural models of computing coherence. It also gives us better insight into the behaviour of the model thus leading to better explainability.

However, studies have shown that existing language models are inadequate in reasoning. To address the issue, we present POET, a new pre-training paradigm. Through pre-training language models with programs and their execution results, POET empowers language models to harvest the reasoning knowledge possessed in program executors via a data-driven approach. POET is conceptually simple and can be instantiated by different kinds of programs. In this paper, we show three empirically powerful instances, i.e., POET-Math, POET-Logic, and POET-SQL. Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate that POET can significantly boost model performance on natural language reasoning, such as numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. Taking the DROP benchmark as a representative example, POET improves the F1 metric of BART from 69.2% to 80.6%. Furthermore, POET shines in giant language models, pushing the F1 metric of T5-11B to 87.6% and achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on DROP.

In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-guided Transformer Model (KTM) for joint theme and emotion classification of Chinese classical poetry. Specifically, we first respectively construct two lexical dictionaries for the theme and emotion based on the poem annotations. Then we take full advantage of the lexical dictionaries with a knowledge-based mask-transformer to represent poems.

Hahn shows that for languages where acceptance depends on a single input symbol, a transformer's classification decisions get closer and closer to random guessing (that is, a cross-entropy of 1) as input strings get longer and longer. We examine this limitation using two languages: PARITY, the language of bit strings with an odd number of 1s, and FIRST, the language of bit strings starting with a 1. We demonstrate three ways of overcoming the limitation implied by Hahn's lemma. First, we settle an open question by constructing a transformer that recognizes PARITY with perfect accuracy, and similarly for FIRST. Second, we use layer normalization to bring the cross-entropy of both models arbitrarily close to zero. Third, when transformers need to focus on a single position, as for FIRST, we find that they can fail to generalize to longer strings; we offer a simple remedy to this problem that also improves length generalization in machine translation.",Anonymous,/forum?id=qc9O2EtrMI-,,,,,

In NLP tasks, those simple features could be token-level features whose spurious association with the label can be learned easily. We show that MLM pretraining makes learning from the context easier. Thus, pretrained models are less likely to rely excessively on a single token. We also explore the theoretical explanations of MLM’s efficacy in causal settings. Compared with Wei et al.

To address that, in this paper, we aim to influence or modulate modality representations with common-sense knowledge obtained from a generative social common-sense knowledge base.

This complex relationship between encoding (production) and decoding (perception) is often modeled separately. Here, we test how decoding of lexical and sublexical semantic information can emerge automatically from raw speech in unsupervised generative deep convolutional networks that combine both the production and perception principle. We introduce, to our knowledge, the most challenging objective in unsupervised lexical learning: an unsupervised network that must learn to assign unique representations for lexical items with no direct access to training data. We train several models (ciwGAN and fiwGAN by Beguš 2021) and test how the networks classify raw acoustic lexical items in the unobserved test data. Strong evidence in favor of lexical learning emerges. The architecture that combines the production and perception principles is thus able to learn to decode unique information from raw acoustic data in an unsupervised manner without ever accessing real training data. We propose a technique to explore lexical and sublexical learned representations in the classifier network. The results bear implications for both unsupervised speech synthesis and recognition as well as for unsupervised semantic modeling as language models increasingly bypass text and operate from raw acoustics.",Anonymous,/forum?id=Vtl4GfQJ9K,/attachment?id=Vtl4GfQJ9K&name=data,,,,

The previous works mainly focused on enriching the information representations of questions and relations, and neglected the interaction information of questions and relations and different tokens within the relation.

Moreover, we combine four levels of relation abstractions to ensure the integrity of relation information and hence to enrich the relation representation. The experimental results on two benchmarks show that our ARCNN model achieves new state-of-the-art accuracies of 96.42% for SimpleQuestions and 90.4% for WebQuestions.

To remedy this problem, we propose a new definition for NMT adversarial examples based on the Doubly Round-Trip Translation (DRTT). Specifically, apart from the source-target-source RTT, we also consider the target-source-target one, which is utilized to pick out the authentic adversarial examples for the target NMT model. Additionally, to enhance the robustness of the NMT model, we introduce the masked language models to construct bilingual adversarial pairs based on DRTT, which are used to train the NMT model directly.

In this work we study a relevant low-resource setting: style transfer for languages where no style-labelled corpora are available. We find that existing few-shot methods perform this task poorly, with a strong tendency to copy inputs verbatim. We push the state-of-the-art for few-shot style transfer with a new method modeling the stylistic difference between paraphrases. When compared to prior work using automatic and human evaluations, our model achieves 2-3x better performance and output diversity in formality transfer and code-mixing addition across seven languages. Moreover, our method is better able to control the amount of style transfer using an input scalar knob. We report promising qualitative results for several attribute transfer directions, including sentiment transfer, text simplification, gender neutralization and text anonymization, all without retraining the model. Finally we found model evaluation to be difficult due to the lack of evaluation datasets and metrics for many languages.

Multi-SentAugment is a self-training method which augments available (typically few-shot) training data with similar (automatically labelled) in-domain sentences from large monolingual Web-scale corpora. LayerAgg learns to select and combine useful semantic information scattered across different layers of a Transformer model (e.g., mBERT); it is especially suited for zero-shot scenarios as semantically richer representations should strengthen the model's cross-lingual capabilities. Applying the two methods with state-of-the-art NLU models obtains consistent improvements across two standard multilingual NLU datasets covering 16 diverse languages. The gains are observed in zero-shot, few-shot, and even in full-data scenarios.

Our approach first uses a contrastive ranker to rank a set of candidate logical forms obtained by searching over the knowledge graph. It then introduces a tailored generation model conditioned on the question and the top-ranked candidates to compose the final logical form. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on GrailQA and WebQSP datasets. In particular, our method surpasses the prior state-of-the-art by a large margin on the GrailQA leaderboard. In addition, RnG-KBQA outperforms all prior approaches on the popular WebQSP benchmark, even including the ones that use the oracle entity linking.

While fine-tuning or few-shot learning can be used to adapt the base model, there is no one simple recipe to getting these working; moreover, one may not have access to the original model weights if it is deployed as a black box. To this end, we study how to improve a black box model's performance on a new domain given examples from the new domain by leveraging explanations of the model's behavior. Our approach first extracts a set of features combining human intuition about the task with model attributions generated by black box interpretation techniques, and then uses a simple model to calibrate or rerank the model's predictions based on the features. We experiment with our method on two tasks, extractive question answering and natural language inference, covering adaptation from several pairs of domains. The experimental results across all the domain pairs show that explanations are useful for calibrating these models.

In this paper, we examine how different varieties of multilingual training contribute to learning these two components of the MT model. Specifically, we compare bilingual models with encoders and/or decoders initialized by multilingual training. We show that multilingual training is beneficial to encoders in general, while it only benefits decoders for low-resource languages (LRLs). We further find the important attention heads for each language pair and compare their correlations during inference. Our analysis sheds light on how multilingual translation models work and also enables us to propose methods to improve performance by training with highly related languages.

However, these encoder-decoder models used the ground truth as the only generation target, resulting in shallow heuristics to generate expressions. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective label augmentation method for equation set problems. Specifically, we transform the ground truth into several equivalent labels by normalization rules, and these new labels will be used as additional generation targets for model training. Experimental results on the English dataset DRAW1K and Chinese dataset HMWP show that the label augmentation method has at most 4.5% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) models.",Anonymous,/forum?id=Zl9PyU7Li2K,/attachment?id=Zl9PyU7Li2K&name=data,,,,

However, it is still unclear that what are the limitations of these neural parsers, and whether these limitations can be compensated by collaborating with symbolic parsers. In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions by taking English Resource Grammar (ERG) parsing as a case study. Specifically, we first develop a state-of-the-art neural ERG parser, and then conduct detailed analyses on fine-grained linguistic phenomena. The results suggest that the neural parser's performance degrades significantly on long-tail examples, while the symbolic parser performs more robustly. To address this, we further propose a collaborative neural-symbolic semantic parsing framework. Specifically, we improve the beam search strategy by designing a decision criterion that incorporates both the model uncertainty about the testing data distribution and the prior knowledge from a symbolic parser. Experimental results show that this collaborative parsing framework can outperform the single neural parser and concretely improve the model's performance on long-tail examples.",Anonymous,/forum?id=H3Fp5M4M8fO,,,,,

As we train auxiliary source-pivot and pivot-target translation models, we initialize some parameters of the pivot side with a pre-trained language model and freeze them to encourage both translation models to work in the same pivot language space, so that they can be smoothly transferred to the source-target translation model.

However, there is a lack of human studies on validating the effect of rationale length on human understanding. Is the shortest rationale indeed the most understandable for humans? To answer this question, we design a self-explaining model that can take control on rationale length. Our model incorporates contextual information and supports flexibly extracting rationales at any target length. Through quantitative evaluation on model performance, we further verify that our method LIMITEDINK outperforms existing self-explaining baselines on both end-task prediction and human-annotated rationale agreement. We use it to generate rationales at 5 length levels, and conduct user studies to understand how much rationale would be sufficient for humans to confidently make predictions. We show that while most prior work extracts 10%-30% of the text to be the rationale, human accuracy tends to stabilize after seeing 40% of the full text.

In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric method that leverages domain-specific text translation corpus to achieve domain adaptation for the E2E-ST system. To this end, we first incorporate an additional encoder into the pre-trained E2E-ST model to realize text translation modeling and then unify the decoder's output representation for text and speech translation tasks by reducing the correspondent representation mismatch in available triplet training data. During domain adaptation, a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifier is introduced to produce the final translation distribution using the external datastore built by the domain-specific text translation corpus, while the universal output representation is adopted to perform a similarity search.

This is problematic, as models using these representations need ways to handle unknown and new words, known as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. As a result, there have been multiple attempts to learn OOV word representations in a similar fashion to how humans learn new words, using surrounding words (``context clues"") and word roots/subwords. However, most current approaches suffer from two problems. First, these models calculate context clue estimates and subword estimates separately and then combine them shallowly for a final estimate, therefore ignoring potentially important information each type can learn from the other. Secondly, although subword embeddings are trained to estimate word vectors, we find these embeddings don't occupy the same space as word embeddings. Current models do not take this into account, and do not align the spaces before combining them. In response to this, we propose Crossword, a transformer based OOV estimation model that combines context and subwords at the attention level, allowing each type to influence the other for a stronger final estimate.

We focus on the scenario of zero-shot transfer from teacher languages with document level data to student languages with no documents but sentence level data, and for the first time treat document-level translation as a transfer learning problem. Using simple concatenation-based DocNMT, we explore the effect of 3 factors on the transfer: the number of teacher languages with document level data, the balance between document and sentence level data at training, and the data type of document level data (genuine vs. back-translated).

If students’ GEP can be measured on course materials frequently, for instance, at the beginning and end of a semester, English teachers can confirm students’ levels of learning achievement. So far, English teachers have two options for GEP measurement: calculating scores for read-aloud or those of dictation performance. This study expands an option to measure GEP using both dictation and read-aloud performances. When comparing the three types of measurement methods, the experimental results suggest that GEP should be measured by calculating dictation and read-aloud performances.",Anonymous,/forum?id=kt6-xydKjf,,,,,

This paper presents Representation ALchemy (RepAL), an extremely simple post-processing method that enhances unsupervised sentence representations. The basic idea in RepAL is to extract redundant information from the representation of a sentence generated by the existing models and then refine the representation through an embedding refinement operation to filter such redundant information. In this paper, we analyze the redundant information from two levels: sentence-level and corpus-level, and the theoretical analysis for the latter is also conducted. We point out that RepAL is free of training and is a plug-and-play method that can be combined with most existing unsupervised sentence learning models. Extensive experiments demonstrate RepAL’s effectiveness and show that RepAL is a model-agnostic method for unsupervised sentence embedding enhancement. Besides, we also designed detailed ablation studies to understand why RepAL works and provided in-depth analysis and understanding of the redundant information.",Anonymous,/forum?id=xHBcjbi8ifL,,/attachment?id=xHBcjbi8ifL&name=software,,,

Without asking for any fine-grained knowledge, FCDC aims at discovering fine-grained categories with only coarse-grained labeled data, which can not only reduce significant labeling costs, but also adapt to novel fine-grained categories. It is also a challenging task since performing FCDC requires models to ensure fine-grained sample separability with only coarse-grained supervision and can easily make models overfit on the training set. Considering most current methods cannot transfer knowledge from coarse-grained level to fine-grained level, we propose a novel hierarchical weighted self-contrastive network to approach the FCDC task. Inspired by the hierarchy of pre-trained models (e.g. BERT), we combine supervised learning and contrastive learning to learn fine-grained knowledge from shallow to deep. Specifically, we use coarse-grained labels to train bottom layers of our model to learn surface knowledge, then we build a novel weighted self-contrastive module to train top layers of our model to learn more fine-grained knowledge.

Currently, these approaches are largely evaluated on in-domain settings. Yet, little is known about how post-hoc explanations and inherently faithful models perform in out-of-domain settings. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study that examines: (1) the out-of-domain faithfulness of post-hoc explanations, generated by five feature attribution methods; and (2) the out-of-domain performance of two inherently faithful models over six datasets. Contrary to our expectations, results show that in many cases out-of-domain post-hoc explanation faithfulness measured by sufficiency and comprehensiveness is higher compared to in-domain. We find this misleading and suggest using a random baseline as a yardstick for evaluating post-hoc explanation faithfulness.

246,VbtRUvpzht,VQN: Variable Quantization Noise for Neural Network Compression,,,,,/pdf?id=VbtRUvpzht,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Quantization refers to a set of methods that compress a neural network by representing its parameters with fewer bits. However, applying quantization to a neural network after training often leads to severe performance regressions. Quantization Aware Training (QAT) addresses this problem by applying simulated training-time quantization for the model to learn robustness to inference-time quantization. One key drawback of this approach is that quantization functions induce biased gradient flow through the network during backpropagation, thus preventing the network from best-fitting to the learning task. Fan et al. addressed this issue by proposing Quant-Noise, in which simulated quantization is applied to a fixed proportion, called the quantization noise rate, of parameters during training. Our study, Variable Quantization Noise (VQN), builds upon their technique by exploring a variable quantization noise rate instead of a fixed one. We craft three candidate functions to vary noise rate during training and evaluate the variants with 3 datasets and 3 quantization schemes for each dataset. First, we report negative results on our hand-crafted candidate functions. Second, we observe somewhat positive results on a method, originally intended as an ablation study, of randomly varying the noise rate during training. This method outperforms Quant-Noise on two out of three quantization schemes for all three tested datasets. Moreover, on two of the datasets, this method at 4x compression matches or exceeds performance of even the uncompressed model. Future work should determine whether these unexpected results hold for more datasets and quantization schemes, as well as investigating other schemes for varying the noise rate during training.",Anonymous,/forum?id=VbtRUvpzht,,,,,

However, manual verbalizers heavily depend on domain-specific prior knowledge and human efforts, while finding appropriate label words automatically still remains challenging.In this work, we propose the prototypical verbalizer (ProtoVerb) which is built directly from training data. Specifically, ProtoVerb learns prototype vectors as verbalizers by contrastive learning. In this way, the prototypes summarize training instances and are able to enclose rich class-level semantics. We conduct experiments on both topic classification and entity typing tasks, and the results demonstrate that ProtoVerb significantly outperforms current automatic verbalizers, especially when training data is extremely scarce.

Analyzing Translate-train & Few-shot Cross-lingual Transfer,,,,,/pdf?id=EsQHxNYt0u,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Translate-train or few-shot cross-lingual transfer can be used to improve the zero-shot performance of multilingual pretrained language models. Few-shot utilizes high-quality low-quantity samples (often manually translated from the English corpus to the target language). Translate-train employs a machine translation of the English corpus, resulting in samples with lower quality that could be scaled to high quantity. Given the lower cost and higher availability of machine translation compared to manual professional translation, it is important to systematically compare few-shot and translate-train, understand when few-shot is beneficial, and whether choosing the shots to translate increases the few-shot gain. This work aims to fill this gap: we compare and quantify the performance gain of few-shot vs. translate-train using a varying number of samples for three tasks/datasets (XNLI, PAWS-X, XQuAD) spanning 17 languages. We show that scaling up the training data using machine translation gives a larger gain compared to using the small-scale (higher-quality) few-shot data. When few-shot is beneficial, we show that there are random sets of samples that perform better across languages and that the performance on English and on the machine-translation of the samples can both be used to choose the shots to manually translate for an increased few-shot gain.",Anonymous,/forum?id=EsQHxNYt0u,,,,,

To find such a subspace and examine its universality, we propose an analysis pipeline called intrinsic prompt tuning (IPT). Specifically, we resort to the recent success of prompt tuning and decompose the soft prompts of multiple NLP tasks into the same low-dimensional nonlinear subspace, then we learn to adapt the PLM to unseen data or tasks by only tuning parameters in this subspace. In the experiments, we study diverse few-shot NLP tasks and surprisingly find that in a 5-dimensional subspace found with 100 tasks, by only tuning 5 free parameters, we can recover 87% and 65% of the full prompt tuning performance for 100 seen tasks (using different training data) and 20 unseen tasks, respectively, showing great generalization ability of the found intrinsic task subspace.

The single matching mechanism model that does not distinguish between the two senses will cause LTSs to be ignored because LTSs are in a weak position. The few-shot learning method that mainly focuses on LTSs is not conducive to grasping the advantage of easy identification of MFSs. This paper proposes a bi-matching mechanism to serve the WSD model to deal with two kinds of senses in a targeted manner, namely definition matching and collocation feature matching.

Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, despite their success in downstream NLP applications, often fail to generalize in a hierarchy-sensitive manner when performing syntactic transformations—for example, transforming declarative sentences into questions—instead generalizing linearly using positional surface heuristics. However, syntactic evaluations of seq2seq models have only observed models that were not pre-trained on natural language data before being trained to perform syntactic transformations, in spite of the fact that pre-training has been found to induce hierarchical linguistic generalizations in language models; in other words, the syntactic capabilities of seq2seq models may have been greatly understated. Here, we make use of the pre-trained seq2seq model T5 (and its multilingual variant mT5) and evaluate whether they generalize hierarchically on two syntactic transformations in two languages: question formation and passivization in English and German. We find that T5 and mT5 generalize hierarchically when performing syntactic transformations, whereas non-pre-trained baseline models do not. This result presents additional evidence for the learnability of hierarchical syntactic information from non-annotated natural language text while also demonstrating that seq2seq models are capable of syntactic generalization.",Anonymous,/forum?id=Jpl3hYq2CItW,,,,,

After each epoch of training, the teacher samples data that it is uncertain to and data it predicts differently from the student, which are passed into the structure for training in the next epoch. As a proof of concept, we use a Bayesian linear classifier as the teacher, and use two commonly used backbone models as the student.

Existing methods treat this task as a sequence labeling problem, while this paper regards it as an entity span classification problem and designs a Biaffine Span Representation (BSR) method to learn contextual span dependency representation to fit into the classification algorithm. The BSR applies a biaffine pooling module to establish the dependencies of each word on the whole sentence and to reduce the dimension of word features, thus, the span representation could gain contextual dependency information to help improve recognition accuracies. Experimental study on four standard NER datasets shows that our proposed BSR method outperforms pre-trained language models and existing N-way K-shot NER algorithms in two types of adaptations (i.e., Intra-Domain Cross-Type Adaptation and Cross-Domain Cross-Type Adaptation).

Many previous works on authorship attribution employed word-based models to capture an author's distinctive writing style. The vocabulary of the training corpus is heavily dependent on the pre-trained word vectors, which limits the performance of these models. Alternate methods using character-based models proposed to overcome the rare word problems arising from different linguistic features fail to capture the sequential relationship of words inherently present in the texts. The question we addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to tackle the ambiguity of hidden writing style (or words) as we introduce Gaussian noise while preserving the sequential context of the text to improve authorship-related tasks. In this work, we propose two bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) with a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) over a two-dimensional pooling operation to capture sequential writing styles for distinguishing different authors. To determine the appropriate writing style representation, we used BLSTM to obtain the sequential relationship between characteristics using subword information and 2D CNN is adopted to understand the local syntactical position of the style from unlabelled input text. We extensively evaluate the model that leverages subword embedding and compare it against state-of-the-art methods for an extensive range of authors.

Instead, we use controlled nearest neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and positive samples by controlling the sampling margin between them. The resulting method SciNCL outperforms the state-of-the-art on the SciDocs benchmark.

Rare code problem, the medical codes with low occurrences, is prominent in medical code prediction. Recent studies employ deep neural networks and the external knowledge to tackle it. However, such approaches lack interpretability which is a vital issue in medical application. Moreover, due to the lengthy and noisy clinical notes, such approaches fail to achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework based on medical concept driven attention to incorporate external knowledge for explainable medical code prediction. In specific, both the clinical notes and Wikipedia documents are aligned into topic space to extract medical concepts using topic modeling. Then, the medical concept-driven attention mechanism is applied to uncover the medical code related concepts which provide explanations for medical code prediction.

We introduce abstract syntax tree (AST) to reflect the structural information of code snippet and adopt the well-recognized 'bag of AST paths' as its intermediate representation, so that the unique structural and syntactic information of programs can be captured. Our proposed SDCR is supported by two core pillars. First, we provide comprehensive empirical study showing that only 1% of the AST paths can account for approximately 75% of the AST path occurrences. That is, dropping most of unnecessary AST paths still allows SDCR to perform well. Second, all AST paths (without leaf nodes in AST) are made up of a limited number of descriptive path elements, for which a lightweight encoder may produce a good embedding of any AST path. Incorporating these two pillars enables us to represent code snippets with better generalizability and scalability.

In contrast to most prior work which only focuses on post classification into a small number of topics (10−20), we consider the task of large-scale topic classification in the context of Twitter where the topic space is 10 times larger with potentially multiple topic associations per Tweet. We address the challenges above and propose a novel neural model, CTM that (a) associates tweets from a large topic space of 300 topics (b) takes a holistic approach to tweet content modeling -- leveraging multi-modal content, author context, and deeper semantic cues in the tweet. We evaluate CTM quantitatively and show that our method offers an effective way to classify Tweets into topics at scale and is superior in performance to other approaches yielding a significant relative lift of 20%.",Anonymous,/forum?id=CxLph8ur-hB,,,,,

One of our contributions is an analysis on how it makes sense through introducing two insightful concepts: missampling and uncertainty. Empirical studies show low missampling rate and high uncertainty are both essential for achieving promising performances with negative sampling. Based on the sparsity of named entities, we also theoretically derive a lower bound for the probability of zero missampling rate, which is only relevant to sentence length. The other contribution is an adaptive and weighted sampling distribution that further improves negative sampling via our former analysis. Experiments on synthetic datasets and well-annotated datasets (e.g., CoNLL-2003) show that our proposed approach benefits negative sampling in terms of F1 score and loss convergence. Besides, models with improved negative sampling have achieved new state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets (e.g., EC).",Anonymous,/forum?id=4YFTlwJIht7,,,,,

Current task-oriented agents produce precise but bland and uninteresting responses. While using such agents a user may interpose personal remarks, and the failure of the agent to process and respond to such statements could be a put-off for the user. In this paper we propose a system that is persona-specific, can handle chit-chat utterances, and produces responses that add a human element to the conversation, while always remaining grounded on the task. Since current task-oriented datasets do not have persona-profiles, and do not consist of personalized remarks in utterances, we modify an existing dataset (MultiWOZ 2.1) to suit our needs. We give a semi-automated dataset creation method that uses GPT-2 model trained on the PERSONA-CHAT dataset. A small subset of the obtained data is also manually crafted to acquire a gold standard data. Our framework is based on GPT-2, Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Memory Network that is trained on this dataset to generate persona-grounded task-oriented responses.

However, currently the performance of discourse models is very low on texts outside of the training distribution's coverage. There is need for a measure that can inform us to what extent our model generalizes from the training to the test sample when these samples may be drawn from distinct distributions. While this can be estimated via distribution shift, we argue that this does not directly correlate with change in the observed error of a classifier (i.e. error-gap). Thus, we propose to use a statistic from the theoretical domain adaptation literature which can be directly tied to error-gap. We study the bias of this statistic as an estimator of error-gap both theoretically and through a large-scale empirical study of over 2400 experiments on 6 discourse datasets from domains including, but not limited to: news, biomedical texts, TED talks, Reddit posts, and fiction. Our results not only motivate our proposal and help us to understand its limitations, but also provide insight on the properties of discourse models and datasets which improve performance in domain adaptation. For instance, we find that non-news datasets are slightly easier to transfer to than news datasets when the training and test sets are very different.

To enhance the antinoise capability of the model, denosing reconstruction is used to reconstruct the corrupted dialog state and response.

Such a simple but powerful method reduces the model size up to 90% compared to conventional KGE models and attains the best performance among small-sized models.

The problem is compounded by users expecting more sophisticated, human-like behavior of IPDAs. Building an automated evaluation mechanism requires high quality ground truth data on user-IPDA interaction success, which incorporates these diverse and changing user expectations. Ignoring them may lead to divergence between user perceptions and what IPDAs are designed to optimize. To address this problem, we describe Response Quality (RQ) annotation and introduce response categories that incorporate the user’s perspective. To validate these categories, we present an in-lab study — the first on a large-scope conversational system that covers hundreds of domains — that tests the hypothesis that users judge human-like responses from IPDAs (like admitted fallibility and relevance) more favorably than non-human-like ones. We find support for this hypothesis, confirming that (1) Generic Fails are highly rated by older users in particular, (2) Irrelevant Responses are rated as poorly as Generic Fails and (3) disambiguation responses are highly rated (with caveats). We then baseline RQ ratings against user ratings to improve RQ’s alignment with user perceptions.",Anonymous,/forum?id=6-l23Qjgu2u,,,,,

We find that adversarial texts generated by ANTHRO achieve the best trade-off between (1) attack success rate, (2) semantic preservation of the original text, and (3) stealthiness--i.e. indistinguishable from human writings hence harder to be flagged as suspicious. Specifically, our attacks accomplished around 83% and 91% attack success rates on BERT and RoBERTa, respectively.

This leads to a lack of generalization in practice and redundant computation. In particular, the state-of-the-art transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) require great time and computation resources. By borrowing an idea from software engineering, in order to address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm, SHIELD, which modifies and re-trains only the last layer of a textual NN, and thus it ""patches"" and ""transforms"" the NN into a stochastic weighted ensemble of multi-expert prediction heads. Considering that most of current black-box attacks rely on iterative search mechanisms to optimize their adversarial perturbations, SHIELD confuses the attackers by automatically utilizing different weighted ensembles of predictors depending on the input. In other words, SHIELD breaks a fundamental assumption of the attack, which is a victim NN model remains constant during an attack. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that all of CNN, RNN, BERT, and RoBERTa-based textual NNs, once patched by SHIELD, exhibit a relative enhancement of 15%--70% in accuracy on average against 14 different black-box attacks, outperforming 6 defensive baselines across 3 public datasets.

While inclusion and accessibility have received attention in recent literature, equity is currently unexplored. We propose to address this gap using the Gini coefficient, a well-established metric used for estimating societal wealth inequality. Using our paradigm, we highlight the distressed state of diversity of current technologies for Indian (IN) languages. Our focus on IN is motivated by their linguistic diversity and their large, varied speaker population. To improve upon these metrics, we demonstrate the importance of region-specific choices in model building and dataset creation and also propose a novel approach to optimal resource allocation during fine-tuning.

One failure mode is misinterpreting a user's instruction (e.g., GPT-3 interpreting ""What word is similar to `good'?"" to mean a homonym, while the user intended a synonym). Our goal is to allow users to correct such errors directly through interaction -- without retraining. Our approach is to pair GPT-3 with a growing memory of cases where the model misunderstood the user's intent and was provided with feedback, clarifying the instruction. Given a new query, our memory-enhanced GPT-3 uses feedback from similar, prior queries to enrich the prompt. Through simple proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate how a user can interactively teach a deployed GPT-3, doubling its accuracy on basic lexical tasks (e.g., generate a synonym) where users query in different, novel (often misunderstood) ways. In such scenarios, memory helps avoid repeating similar past mistakes.

In particular, randomly-generated character n-grams lack semantic meaning but contain primitive information based on the distribution of characters they contain. By studying the embeddings of a large corpus of garble, extant language, and pseudowords using CharacterBERT, we identify an axis in the model's high-dimensional embedding space that separates these classes of n-grams. Furthermore, we show that this axis relates to structure within extant language, including word part of speech, morphology, and concreteness.

When conditioning the response on these factoids, previous work has either treated the factoids as a weighed average vector, or separately computed probabilities for each <context, factoid> pair. However, the former creates a bottleneck whilst the latter prevents factoids from being considered jointly. Our new method, PolyMemNet, learns a matrix representation of the context and factoids, allowing for multiple factoids to be jointly considered in response selection, without imposing a bottleneck.

We introduce the task of fact-checking in dialogue, which is a relatively unexplored area. We construct DialFact, a testing benchmark dataset of 22,123 annotated conversational claims, paired with pieces of evidence from Wikipedia. There are three sub-tasks in DialFact: 1) Verifiable claim detection task distinguishes whether a response carries verifiable factual information; 2) Evidence retrieval task retrieves the most relevant Wikipedia snippets as evidence; 3) Claim verification task predicts a dialogue response to be supported, refuted, or not enough information. We found that existing fact-checking models trained on non-dialogue data like FEVER} fail to perform well on our task, and thus, we propose a simple yet data-efficient solution to effectively improve fact-checking performance in dialogue. We point out unique challenges in DialFact such as handling the colloquialisms, coreferences and retrieval ambiguities in the error analysis to shed light on future research in this direction.",Anonymous,/forum?id=AxPhYKiSbp,,,,,

Such models include neural-net language models, but not n-gram language models or, indeed, tokenizers, the topic of this work. Training a tokenizer normally requires access to the training data. An alternative is to train the tokenizer on publicly available data, but this, we show, degrades accuracy for a next-word prediction task by 10-20% across different datasets and models. We propose to take a tokenizer built on public data, use it to train a language model with PFL, and sample from the language model to find a new tokenizer. Retraining with the new tokenizer brings performance to within 2\,\% of the oracle tokenizer, without expending additional privacy budget.

To increase its efficiency and prevent catastrophic forgetting and interference, techniques like adapters and sparse fine-tuning have been developed. Adapters are modular, as they can be combined to adapt a model towards different facets of knowledge (e.g., dedicated language and/or task adapters). Sparse fine-tuning is expressive, as it controls the behavior of all model components. In this work, we introduce a new fine-tuning method with both these desirable properties. In particular, we learn sparse, real-valued masks based on a simple variant of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. Task-specific masks are obtained from annotated data in a source language, and language-specific masks from masked language modeling in a target language. Both these masks can then be composed with the pretrained model. Unlike adapter-based fine-tuning, this method neither increases the number of parameters at inference time nor alters the original model architecture. Most importantly, it outperforms adapters in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer by a large margin in a series of multilingual benchmarks, including Universal Dependencies, MasakhaNER, and AmericasNLI. Based on an in-depth analysis, we additionally find that sparsity is crucial to prevent both 1) interference between the fine-tunings to be composed and 2) overfitting.

While this post-processing step is crucial for producing clean transcripts and high performance on downstream tasks (e.g. machine translation), most current state-of-the-art NLP models such as the Transformer operate non-incrementally, potentially causing unacceptable delays for the user. In this work we propose a streaming BERT-based sequence tagging model that, combined with a novel training objective, is capable of detecting disfluencies in real-time while balancing accuracy and latency. This is accomplished by training the model to decide whether to immediately output a prediction for the current input or to wait for further context, in essence learning to dynamically size the lookahead window. Our results demonstrate that our model produces comparably accurate predictions and does so sooner than our baselines, with lower flicker.

In this work, we introduce a method, TABi, to jointly train bi-encoders on unstructured text and structured types for end-to-end retrieval. TABi uses a type-enforced contrastive loss to encode type information in the embedding space and trains over datasets from multiple open-domain tasks to learn to retrieve entities. We demonstrate that this simple method can improve retrieval of rare entities on the AmbER sets, while maintaining strong overall performance on retrieval for open-domain tasks when compared to state-of-the-art retrievers.

Training either language-pair specific or language-agnostic adapters while keeping most of the pretrained model's parameters frozen has been proposed as a lightweight alternative. However, the former do not learn useful cross-lingual representations for multiple language pairs, while the latter share parameters for all languages and potentially have to deal with negative interference.

As such, they often complement distributional text-based information and facilitate various downstream tasks. Since their manual construction is resource- and time-intensive, recent efforts have tried leveraging large pretrained language models (PLMs) to generate additional monolingual knowledge facts for KBs. However, such methods have not been attempted for building and enriching multilingual KBs. Besides wider application, such multilingual KBs can provide richer combined knowledge than monolingual (e.g., English) KBs. Knowledge expressed in different languages may be complementary and unequally distributed: this implies that the knowledge available in high-resource languages can be transferred to low-resource ones. To achieve this, it is crucial to represent multilingual knowledge in a shared/unified space. To this end, we propose a unified representation model, Prix-LM, for multilingual KB construction and completion. We leverage two types of knowledge, monolingual triples and cross-lingual links, extracted from existing multilingual KBs, and tune a multilingual language encoder XLM-R via a causal language modeling objective. Prix-LM integrates useful multilingual and KB-based factual knowledge into a single model.

In this paper, we take a meta-learning viewpoint for parameter-efficient fine-tuning in few-shot settings.

There are a total of 8.06 million emotes, over 400k of which were observed during the study period. There is virtually no information on the meaning or sentiment of emotes, and with a constant influx of new emotes and drift in both their frequencies and their perceived meanings, it becomes impossible to maintain an updated manually-labeled dataset. Our paper makes a two-fold contribution. First, we establish a new baseline for sentiment analysis on Twitch data, outperforming the previous benchmark by 7.36 percentage points. Secondly, we introduce a simple but powerful unsupervised framework based on word embeddings and k-NN to enrich existing models with out-of-vocabulary knowledge. This framework allows us to auto-generate an emote pseudo-dictionary, and we show that we can nearly match the supervised benchmark above, even when injecting such emote knowledge into sentiment classifiers trained on extraneous datasets such as movie reviews or Twitter.",Anonymous,/forum?id=8n2gOQ6sOBn,,,,,

A promising way to solve this task is a two-stage pipeline, where the first stage retrieves a set of candidates, and the second stage uses a neural network to rank the retrieved candidates. There are three standard methods to train neural rankers, Binary Cross-Entropy loss, Mean Square Error loss, and Hinge loss. While all these training strategies assign the same label for all the negative candidates, we argue that negativeness is not binary but exists as a spectrum, i.e., some candidates may be more negative than the others, and thus should be treated differently. We present SCONER---scoring negative candidates before training neural ranker---a model trained to differentiate negative candidates. Our approach includes 1) semantic textual similarity-based scoring together with data augmentation for score generation of negative candidates, and 2) a neural ranker trained on data using generated scores as labels. Together, we systematically compare three standard training methods and our proposed method on a range of ReQA datasets under multiple settings (i.e., single-domain and multi-domain). Our finding suggests that using more negative candidates to train neural rankers are better than less in both single- and multi-domain settings, where SCONER is the best in the single-domain settings and Hinge loss is the best in multi-domain settings.",Anonymous,/forum?id=oyCPRgwkf5w,,,,,

Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e., the proof graph) that emulate the model’s logical reasoning process. But these models behave as a black-box unit that emulates the reasoning process without any causal constraints in the reasoning steps, thus questioning the faithfulness. In this work, we frame the deductive logical reasoning task as a causal process by defining three modular components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to the inference reasoning. To test our causal reasoning framework, we propose CausalR, where the above three components are independently modeled by transformers. We observe that CausalR is robust to novel language perturbations, and performs on par with previous works on existing reasoning datasets. Furthermore, the errors made by CausalR are more interpretable due to our multi-modular approach compared to black-box generative models.",Anonymous,/forum?id=vuAX_4bv8A,,/attachment?id=vuAX_4bv8A&name=software,,,

To accomplish this, the system must satisfy a role specification that includes certain conditions on the stated features as well as a system policy on whether or not certain types of utterances are allowed.

Therefore, it is unclear about the ability of a model to perform step-by-step reasoning when finding an answer for a comparison question that requires comparison and numerical reasoning skills. To evaluate the model completely in a hierarchical manner, we first propose a dataset, HieraDate, created by reusing and enhancing two previous multi-hop datasets, HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA.

By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, we find that Seq2Seq pretraining is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it helps NMT models to produce more diverse translations and reduce adequacy-related translation errors. On the other hand, the discrepancies between Seq2Seq pretraining and NMT finetuning limit the translation quality (i.e., domain discrepancy) and induce the over-estimation issue (i.e., objective discrepancy). Based on these observations, we further propose simple and effective strategies, named in-domain pretraining and input adaptation to remedy the domain and objective discrepancies, respectively.

In text-to-table, given a text, one creates a table or several tables expressing the main content of the text, while the model is learned from text-table pair data. The problem setting differs from those of the existing methods for IE. First, the extraction can be carried out from long texts to large tables with complex structures. Second, the extraction is entirely data-driven, and there is no need to explicitly define the schemas. As far as we know, there has been no previous work that studies the problem. In this work, we formalize text-to-table as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) problem. We first employ a seq2seq model fine-tuned from a pre-trained language model to perform the task. We also develop a new method within the seq2seq approach, exploiting two additional techniques in table generation: table constraint and table relation embeddings. We consider text-to-table as an inverse problem of the well-studied table-to-text, and make use of four existing table-to-text datasets in our experiments on text-to-table.

In our study, we employ cloze prompts to elicit event-related knowledge from pre-trained language models and further use event definitions and keywords to pinpoint the trigger word. By formulating the event detection task as an ""identify-then-localize"" procedure, we minimize the number of type-specific parameters, enabling our model to quickly adapt to event detection tasks for new types.

At inference time, instead of the standard Gaussian distribution used by VAE, CUC-VAE allows sampling from an utterance-specific prior distribution conditioned on cross-utterance information, which allows the prosody features generated by the TTS system to be related to the context and is more similar to how humans naturally produce prosody. The performance of CUC-VAE is evaluated via a qualitative listening test for naturalness, intelligibility and quantitative measurements, including word error rates and the standard deviation of prosody attributes.

However, several questions remain, such as ``Do changes in the style and content of text across geographic regions impact model performance?''. We introduce a novel dataset called GeoOLID with more than 13 thousand examples across 15 geographically and demographically diverse cites to address this question. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive analysis of geographical content and stylistic differences and their interaction in causing performance disparities of Offensive Language Detection models. Overall, we find that current models do not generalize across.

We argue that running DADC over many rounds maximizes its training-time benefits, as the different rounds can together cover many of the task-relevant phenomena. We present the first study of longer-term DADC, where we collect 20 rounds of NLI examples for a small set of premise paragraphs, with both adversarial and non-adversarial approaches. Models trained on DADC examples make 26% fewer errors on our expert-curated test set compared to models trained on non-adversarial data.

Inspired by this discovery, we then propose approaches to improving it, with respect to model structure and model training, to make the deep decoder practical in NMT. Specifically, with respect to model structure, we propose a cross-attention drop mechanism to allow the decoder layers to perform their own different roles, to reduce the difficulty of deep-decoder learning. For model training, we propose a collapse reducing training approach to improve the stability and effectiveness of deep-decoder training. We experimentally evaluated our proposed Transformer NMT model structure modification and novel training methods on several popular machine translation benchmarks. The results showed that deepening the NMT model by increasing the number of decoder layers successfully prevented the deepened decoder from degrading to an unconditional language model. In contrast to prior work on deepening an NMT model on the encoder, our method can deepen the model on both the encoder and decoder at the same time, resulting in a deeper model and improved performance.",Anonymous,/forum?id=uELLijm1osF,,,,,

Consequently, a `one size fits all' technique is not the best way for a dialog agent to generate responses. While many studies design personalized dialog agents with the help of persona information of speakers, all of them assume that speaker persona is supplied beforehand. However, this assumption does not hold for all conversational agents. This paper attempts to address this gap by exploring the task -- Speaker Profiling in Conversations (SPC). The aim of SPC is to produce a summary of the persona characteristics for individual speakers present in a dialog. We divide this task into two subtasks -- persona discovery and persona-type identification. Given a dialog, the former subtask aims to find all its utterances that carry persona information. The latter subtask focuses on evaluating these utterances to identify the type of persona information present in them. We present SPICE, a novel dataset that is specifically curated with labels to tackle the task of SPC. We show the performance of various baselines on SPICE and benchmark it using SPOT, a neural model based on GRU and Transformer. SPOT shows an improvement of ~7% for persona discovery and ~3% for persona-type identification over the best baseline. We further present a thorough analysis of SPOT to diagnose individual modules and their limitations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.",Anonymous,/forum?id=iozkB44VlOl,/attachment?id=iozkB44VlOl&name=data,/attachment?id=iozkB44VlOl&name=software,,,

Nevertheless, given the complexity of the task, especially the complexity of the sentences used for model evaluations, it remains controversial whether these models can truly infer the meaning of sentences or they simply guess the answer via non-humanlike heuristics. Here, we reduce the complexity of the task using two approaches. The first approach simplifies the relationship between the premise and hypothesis by making them unrelated. A test set, referred to as Random Pair, is constructed by randomly pairing premises and hypotheses in MNLI/SNLI. Models fine-tuned on MNLI/SNLI identify a large proportion (up to 77.6%) of these unrelated statements as being contradictory. Models fine-tuned on SICK, a dataset that included unrelated premise-hypothesis pairs, perform well on Random Pair. The second approach simplifies the task by constraining the premises/hypotheses to be syntactically/semantically simple sentences. A new test set, referred to as Simple Pair, is constructed using simple sentences, such as short SVO sentences, and basic conjunction sentences. We find that models fine-tuned on MNLI/SNLI generally fail to understand these simple sentences, but their performance can be boosted by re-fine-tuning the models using only a few hundreds of samples from SICK. All models tested here, however, fail to understand the fundamental compositional binding relation between a subject and a predicate (up to ~100% error rate) for basic conjunction sentences. Taken together, the results show that models achieving high accuracy on mainstream datasets can still lack basic sentence comprehension capacity, and datasets discouraging non-humanlike heuristics are required to build more robust NLI models.",Anonymous,/forum?id=FzJk5alRVP,/attachment?id=FzJk5alRVP&name=data,/attachment?id=FzJk5alRVP&name=software,,,

To improve the ability of fast cross-domain adaptation, we propose Prompt-based Environmental Self-exploration (ProbES), which can self-explore the environments by sampling trajectories and automatically generates structured instructions via a large-scale cross-modal pretrained model (CLIP). Our method fully utilizes the knowledge learned from CLIP to build an in-domain dataset by self-exploration without human labeling. Unlike the conventional approach of fine-tuning, we introduce prompt tuning to achieve fast adaptation for language embeddings, which substantially improves the learning efficiency by leveraging prior knowledge.

Different from existing baselines, we enrich the samples via a novel pipeline for data augmentation: for questions, we introduce token-level augmentation (i.e., synonym replacement and token swapping), and, for contexts, we develop hidden-space augmentation which learns to drop context spans via a custom attentive sampling strategy. (2) The QA model is based on transformers. However, unlike existing approaches, we propose to train it via a novel attention-based contrastive adaptation.

The severe data sparse issue with tail labels is more announced in recent neural classifiers, where the embeddings of both the input documents and the output labels need to be jointly learned, and the success of such learning relies on the availability of sufficient training instances. This paper addresses this tough challenge in XMTC by proposing a novel approach that combines the strengths of both traditional bag-of-words (BoW) classifiers and recent neural embedding based classifiers. Specifically, we use a trained BoW model to generate a pseudo description for each label, and apply a neural model to establish the mapping between input documents and target labels in the latent embedding spaces.

However, empirical results using CAD during training for OOD generalization have been mixed. To explain this discrepancy, through a toy theoretical example and empirical analysis on two crowdsourced CAD datasets, we show that: (a) while features perturbed in CAD are indeed robust features, it may prevent the model from learning unperturbed robust features; and (b) CAD may exacerbate existing spurious correlations in the data.

Inspired by the natural reading process of human, we propose to regularize the parser with phrases extracted by an unsupervised phrase tagger to help the LM model quickly manage low-level structures. For a better understanding of high-level structures, we propose a phrase-guided masking strategy for LM to emphasize more on reconstructing non-phrase words.

We first explore different serialization designing strategies for converting parsing structures into sequences. Then we design dependency units and concatenate these units into the sequence for DPSG. Thanks to the high flexibility of the sequence generation, our DPSG can achieve both syntactic DP and semantic DP using a single model. By concatenating the prefix to indicate the specific schema with the sequence, our DPSG can even accomplish the multi-schemata parsing. The effectiveness of our DPSG is demonstrated by the experiments on widely used DP benchmarks, i.e., PTB, CODT, SDP15, and SemEval16.

In the existing literature, NLU and DM have been tackled as two independent tasks, requiring separate labeled data. Besides this problem of additional data requirements, NLU and DM also introduce errors in the pipe-lined processing of dialogue. Direct generation of responses from the user utterances without using any intermediate NLU and DM modules is, thus, a worthy goal. To accomplish this, the model should be able to (implicitly) understand the intent of the user, fetch the appropriate data from the knowledge base, (implicitly) decide an action by looking at the fetched data and conversation history, and finally, generate the response.

The quality of pseudo-labels, especially the initial ones, is crucial to final performance but they are inevitably noisy due to their heuristic nature, so selecting the correct ones has a huge potential for performance boost. One straightforward solution is to select samples based on the softmax probability scores corresponding to their pseudo-labels. However, we show through our experiments that such methods are ineffective and unstable due to the erroneously high-confidence predictions from poorly calibrated models. Recent studies on the memorization effects of deep neural models suggest that these models first memorize training samples with clean labels and then those with noisy labels. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel pseudo-label selection method LOPS that takes learning order of samples into consideration. We hypothesize that the learning order reflects the probability of wrong annotation in terms of ranking, and therefore, select the top samples that are learnt earlier.

However, these models are still quite behind the SOTA KGC models in terms of performance. In this work, we find two main reasons for the weak performance: (1) Inaccurate evaluation setting. The evaluation setting under the closed-world assumption (CWA) may underestimate the PLM-based KGC models since they introduce more external knowledge; (2) Inappropriate utilization of PLMs. Most PLM-based KGC models simply splice the labels of entities and relations as inputs, leading to incoherent sentences that do not take full advantage of the implicit knowledge in PLMs. To alleviate these problems, we highlight a more accurate evaluation setting under the open-world assumption (OWA), which manual checks the correctness of knowledge that is not in KGs. Moreover, motivated by prompt tuning, we propose a novel PLM-based KGC model named PKGC. The basic idea is to convert each triple and its support information into natural prompt sentences, which is further fed into PLMs for classification. Experiment results on two KGC datasets demonstrate OWA is more reliable for evaluating KGC, especially on the link prediction, and the effectiveness of our PKCG model on both CWA and OWA settings.",Anonymous,/forum?id=_wHAe6eoT8,,,,,

For the Chinese language, however, there is no subword because each token is an atomic character. The meaning of a word in Chinese is different in that a word is a compositional unit consisting of multiple characters. Such difference motivates us to investigate whether WWM leads to better context understanding ability for Chinese BERT. To achieve this, we introduce two probing tasks related to grammatical error correction and ask pretrained models to revise or insert tokens in a masked language modeling manner. We construct a dataset including labels for 19,075 tokens in 10,448 sentences. We train three Chinese BERT models with standard character-level masking (CLM), WWM, and a combination of CLM and WWM, respectively.

Second, when more than one character needs to be handled, WWM is the key to better performance.

The first task learns to select the correct sentiment words within the input, given the overall sentiment polarity as prior knowledge. On the contrary, the second task predicts the overall sentiment polarity given the sentiment polarity of the word as prior knowledge. In addition, two kinds of label combination methods are investigated to unify multiple types of labels in each task. We argue that more information can promote the models to learn more profound semantic representation. We implement it in a straightforward way to verify this hypothesis.

Specifically, we extract sentences from the Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus (HUTB), we permute the preverbal constituents of those sentences, and we build a classifier to predict which sentences actually occurred in the corpus against our generated distractors. The classifier uses a number of discourse-based features and cognitive features to make its predictions, including dependency length, surprisal, and information status. We find that lexical and syntactic priming and referent givenness drive order preferences. Moreover, along the lines of previous work in psycholinguistics, we find that certain verbs are more susceptible to priming than others. We conclude by situating our results within the broader syntactic priming literature.",Anonymous,/forum?id=dLmmkAkIWSF,,,,,

One of such problems is the excessive computational resources required to train an acquisition model and estimate its uncertainty on instances in the unlabeled pool. We propose two techniques that tackle this issue for text classification and tagging tasks, offering a substantial reduction of AL iteration duration and the computational overhead introduced by deep acquisition models in AL. We also demonstrate that our algorithm that leverages pseudolabeling and distilled models overcomes one of the essential obstacles revealed previously in the literature. Namely, it was shown that due to differences between an acquisition model used to select instances during AL and a successor model trained on the labeled data, the benefits of AL can diminish.

A verbalizer is usually handcrafted or searched by gradient descent, which may lack coverage and bring considerable bias and high variances to the results. In this work, we focus on incorporating external knowledge into the verbalizer, forming a knowledgeable prompttuning (KPT), to improve and stabilize prompttuning.

HADE utilizes manual annotated Valance-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) vectors of single words and implicitly extracts affective information from utterances. Then, it introduces a hierarchical architecture with the dialog state embeddings to identify the speakers and encode the whole dialog flow. Finally, the affective information is integrated by an auxiliary VAD regression task to enhance personality recognition. Extensive experiments on a well-known dataset, \textbf{FriendsPersona}, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with state-of-the-art models. Besides, we conduct an ablation study to discuss different approaches for integrating affective information and dialog flow modeling; the design of both parts in HADE is also verified to be effective for personality recognition in conversation.",Anonymous,/forum?id=cpMUiyD9EA,,,,,

Such information is conventionally specified in terms of intents and slots contained in task-specific ontology or schemata. Since these schemata are designed by system developers, the naming convention for slots and intents is not uniform across tasks, and may not convey their semantics effectively. This can lead to models memorizing arbitrary patterns in data, resulting in suboptimal performance and generalization. In this paper, we propose that schemata should be modified by replacing names or notations entirely with natural language descriptions. We show that a language description-driven system exhibits better understanding of task specifications, higher performance on state tracking, improved data efficiency, and effective zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks. Following this paradigm, we present a simple yet effective Description-Driven Dialog State Tracking (D3ST) model, which relies purely on schema descriptions and an ""index-picking'' mechanism. We demonstrate the superiority in quality, data efficiency and robustness of our approach as measured on the MultiWOZ (Budzianowski et al.,2018), SGD (Rastogi et al., 2020), and the recent SGD-X (Lee et al., 2021) benchmarks.",Anonymous,/forum?id=NaVgf-NPQev,,,,,

To better capture entity knowledge, a common procedure in prior work is to start with a base LM such as BERT and to modify the LM architecture or objective function to produce a knowledge-aware LM. Proposed knowledge-aware LMs perform well compared to base LMs on entity-rich tasks; however deploying, understanding, and maintaining many different specialized architectures is challenging, and they also often introduce additional computational costs. Thus we ask to what extent we can match the quality of these architectures using a base LM and only changing the data. We propose metadata shaping, a method which inserts readily available entity metadata, such as descriptions and categorical tags, into examples at train and inference time based on mutual information. Intuitively, if metadata corresponding to popular entities overlap with metadata for rare entities, the LM may be able to better reason about the rare entities using patterns learned from similar popular entities. On standard entity-rich tasks (TACRED, FewRel, OpenEntity), metadata shaping exceeds the BERT-baseline by an average of 4.3 F1 points and achieves state-of-the-art results. We further show the gains are on average 4.4x larger for the slice of examples containing tail vs. popular entities.",Anonymous,/forum?id=7A4Fel5OBYQ,,,,,

To extract relation and entity information required for the 3D matrix reasonably, we design a transformer-decoder-based fusion module that updates the representation of relations and entities iteratively.

Specifically, the plugin on the input are a few continuous vectors, which manipulates the PLM without modifying its parameters, and each task only needs to store the lightweight vectors rather than a full copy of PLM. To avoid redeployment, we propose the label word mechanism, which reuses the language model head to prevent task-specific classifiers from modifying model structures.

To better mitigate the discrepancy between pre-training and translation, MSP divides the translation process via pre-trained language models into three separate stages: the encoding stage, the re-encoding stage, and the decoding stage. During each stage, we independently apply different continuous prompts for allowing pre-trained language models better shift to translation tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on three translation tasks. Experiments show that our method can significantly improve the translation performance of pre-trained language models.",Anonymous,/forum?id=Uhnw1smvKt,,,,,

To lay a foundation for studies on emotions in task-oriented dialogues, we introduce EmoWOZ, a large-scale manually emotion-annotated corpus of task-oriented dialogues. EmoWOZ is based on MultiWOZ, a multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset. It contains more than 11K dialogues with more than 83K emotion annotations of user utterances. In addition to Wizard-of-Oz dialogues from MultiWOZ, we collect human-machine dialogues within the same set of domains to sufficiently cover the space of various emotions that can happen during the lifetime of a data-driven dialogue system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale open-source corpus of its kind. We propose a novel emotion labelling scheme, which is tailored to task-oriented dialogues.

However, it is utopian that the word order strictly obeys the grammar rules in a language, especially in oral. To address the mismatch between SimulNMT expecting strict word order and free word order in real scenario, we propose a bidirectional modeling. In detail, we train another backward model where the input sentence is from right-to-left and keep the target sentence from left-to-right. Then we join this backward model into the standard forward SimulNMT model during decoding. This strategy enhances the robustness of SimulNMT and empowers the model to be more adaptable for the inconstant word ordering phenomenon.

We develop a testbed for the multi-granularity summarization task, including a new human-annotated benchmark GranuDUC where each document is paired with multiple summaries with different granularities. Extensive experiments on this benchmark and other large-scale datasets show that GranuSum substantially outperforms previous baselines.

DCNER consists: (1) a Dual-stream Label Distillation mechanism for distilling five types of inconsistent labeling instances from the noisy data; and (2) a Consistency-aware Label Calibration network for calibrating inconsistent labeling instances based on relatively clean data. Additionally, we propose the first benchmark towards validating the ability of Chinese NER to resist inconsistent labeling instances.

However, these methods are limited in that they can only be applied to modules implemented using trainable neural-based methods. To address this problem, we propose a method for optimizing a pipeline system composed of modules implemented with arbitrary methods for dialogue performance. In our method, neural-based components called post-processing networks (PPNs) are installed inside the system to post-process the output of each module. All PPNs are updated to improve the overall dialogue performance of the system by using reinforcement learning, not necessitating each module to be updated. Through dialogue simulation experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, we show that PPNs can improve the dialogue performance of pipeline systems consisting of various modules.",Anonymous,/forum?id=l1xUIpGuuAK,,,,,

The first one focuses on chatting with users and making them engage in the conversations, where selecting a proper topic to fit the dialogue context is essential for a successful dialogue. The other one focuses on a specific task instead of casual talks, e.g., finding a movie on Friday night, playing a song. These two directions have been studied separately due to their different purposes. However, how to smoothly transition from social chatting to task-oriented dialogues is important for triggering the business opportunities, and there is no any public data focusing on such scenarios. Hence, this paper focuses on investigating the conversations starting from open-domain social chatting and then gradually transitioning to task-oriented purposes, and releases a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations for encouraging this research direction. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a framework to automatically generate many dialogues without human involvement, in which any powerful open-domain dialogue generation model can be easily leveraged. The human evaluation shows that our generated dialogue data has a natural flow at a reasonable quality, showing that our released data has a great potential of guiding future research directions and commercial activities. Furthermore, the released models allow researchers to automatically generate unlimited dialogues in the target scenarios, which can greatly benefit semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches.",Anonymous,/forum?id=0Wky3xP0347,/attachment?id=0Wky3xP0347&name=data,,,,

In this work, we propose nichetargeting solutions for this issues. First, we introduce a novel labeling strategy, which contains two sets of token pair labels, namely essential labels and whole labels. The essential label set consists of the minimum labels for this task, which are relatively balanced and applied in the prediction layer. The whole label set includes rich labels to help our model capture various token relations, which is imbalanced but merely applied in the hidden layer to softly influence our model. Moreover, we also propose an effective model to well collaborate with our labeling strategy, which is equipped with the graph attention network to iteratively refine token representations, and the adaptive multi-label classification to dynamically predict multiple relations between token pairs. We perform extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets in four languages. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous SOTA models by a large margin.

Meanwhile, the focus of advanced studies has changed primarily to estimating the relationship between the discovered topical structure and theoretically relevant metadata. Methods used to estimate such relationships must take into account that the topical structure is not directly observed, but instead being estimated itself in an unsupervised fashion. In the Structural Topic Model (STM;Roberts et al., 2016), for instance, multiple repeated linear regressions of sampled topic proportions on metadata covariates are performed. This is done by using a Monte Carlo sampling technique known as the \textit{method of composition}. In this paper, we propose two modifications of this approach: First, we implement a substantial correction to the model by replacing linear regression with the more appropriate Beta regression. Second, we provide a fundamental enhancement of the entire estimation framework by substituting the current blending of frequentist and Bayesian methods with a fully Bayesian approach instead. This allows for a more appropriate quantification of uncertainty.

To tackle this problem, we propose to augment the dual-stream VLP model with a textual pre-trained language model (PLM) via vision-language knowledge distillation (VLKD), enabling the capability for multimodal generation. VLKD is pretty data- and computation-efficient compared to the pre-training from scratch. Experimental results show that the resulting model has strong zero-shot performance on multimodal generation tasks, such as open-ended visual question answering and image captioning. For example, it achieves 39.7% zero-shot accuracy on the VQA 2.0 dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art zero-shot model with 14x fewer parameters.

To this end, we pre-train BERT with two linguistically motivated objectives and three non-linguistically motivated ones.

709,-MoY6seu_x,Bootstrapping Text Anonymization Models with Distant Supervision,,,,,/pdf?id=-MoY6seu_x,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We propose a novel method to bootstrap text anonymization models based on distant supervision. Instead of requiring manually labeled training data, the approach relies on a knowledge graph expressing the background information assumed to be publicly available about various individuals. This knowledge graph is employed to automatically annotate text documents including personal data about a subset of those individuals. More precisely, the method determines which text spans ought to be masked in order to guarantee k-anonymity, assuming an adversary with access to both the text documents and the background information expressed in the knowledge graph. The resulting collection of labeled documents is then used as training data to fine-tune a pre-trained language model for text anonymization. We illustrate this approach using a knowledge graph extracted from Wikidata and short biographical texts from Wikipedia. Evaluation results with a BERT-based model and a manually annotated collection of 553 summaries showcase the potential of the approach, but also unveil a number of issues that may arise the knowledge graph is noisy or incomplete. The results also illustrate that, contrary to most sequence labeling problems, the text anonymization task may admit several alternative solutions.",Anonymous,/forum?id=-MoY6seu_x,,,,,

In this work, we investigate the effects of domain specialization of pretrained language models (PLMs) for TOD. Within our DS-TOD framework, we first automatically extract salient domain-specific terms, and then use them to construct DomainCC and DomainReddit -- resources that we leverage for domain-specific pretraining, based on (i) masked language modeling (MLM) and (ii) response selection (RS) objectives, respectively. We further propose a resource-efficient and modular domain specialization by means of domain adapters -- additional parameter-light layers in which we encode the domain knowledge. Our experiments with prominent TOD tasks -- dialog state tracking (DST) and response retrieval (RR) -- encompassing five domains from the MultiWOZ benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of DS-TOD. Moreover, we show that the light-weight adapter-based specialization (1) performs comparably to full fine-tuning in single domain setups and (2) is particularly suitable for multi-domain specialization, where besides advantageous computational footprint, it can offer better downstream performance.",Anonymous,/forum?id=u-BLrzX2UnV,/attachment?id=u-BLrzX2UnV&name=data,/attachment?id=u-BLrzX2UnV&name=software,,,

Although advanced studies on RTE have achieved great progress, they are still insufficient for supporting practical applications, such as dialogue system and information retrieval. In this paper, we focus on relational triplet extraction in dialogue scenarios and introduce a new task named dialogue relational triplet extraction (DRTE). Instead of being treated as static texts like sentences or documents, dialogues should be regarded as dynamic ones generated with the progress of conversations. Thus, it imposes three important challenges, including extracting triplets in real-time with incomplete dialogue context, discovering cross-utterance relational triplets, and perceiving the transition of dialogue topics. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Entity Memory Network (DEMN). Specifically, the key of our approach is an attentional context encoder and an entity memory network. The attentional context encoder learns dialogue semantics utterance by utterance and dynamically captures salient contexts for each utterance. The entity memory network is devised to store the entities extracted from previous utterances and for cross-utterance triplets extraction. Meanwhile, it also tracks topic transitions in real-time and forgets the semantics of trivial entities. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we manually build three datasets based on KdConv benchmark.

The routing fluctuation tends to harm sample efficiency because the same input updates different experts but only one is finally used. In this paper, we propose StableMoE with two training stages to address the routing fluctuation problem. In the first training stage, we learn a balanced and cohesive routing strategy and distill it into a lightweight router decoupled from the backbone model. In the second training stage, we utilize the distilled router to determine the token-to-expert assignment and freeze it for a stable routing strategy.

CQARE carries out a RE task-specific pre-training with four entity-relation-aware pre-training objects, including a prompt pre-training to automatically generate continuous prompts. The proposed pre-training can provide more robust initialization with prompt tuning while maintaining semantic consistency with the proposed PLM.

A typical approach is to leverage unsupervised and semi-supervised learning to train a neural encoder to produce representations of utterances that are adequate for clustering then perform clustering on the representations to detect unseen clusters of intents. Recently, instance-level contrastive learning has been proposed to improve representation quality for better clustering. However, the proposed method suffers from semantic distortion in text augmentation and even from representation inadequacy due to limitations of using representations of pre-trained language models, typically BERT. Neural encoders can be powerful representation learners, but the initial parameters of pre-trained language models do not reliably produce representations that are suitable for capturing semantic distances.

Many prior methods mainly retrieve question related evidences from the structured knowledge base as the background material of the question, while the extracted evidence is generally described through the entities and the relationship between the entities, making it difficult for the machine to understand the meaning of the evidence completely. In this paper, we integrate the paraphrase in WordNet and Wiktionary into the evidence extraction process and machine reading comprehension (MRC) model, and propose a context-paraphrase enhanced commonsense question answering method. Specifically, the context-paraphrase obtained by WordNet and Wiktionary is first incorporated into the construction process of the heterogeneous graph, and the question related triple is extracted based on the heterogeneous graph, the triple is converted to triple-text based on a relational template. Then, the triple-text is used as the context of the question to establish an association graph containing the relationship between the context entities and the paraphrases.

Because the slot tagging samples are multiple consecutive words in a sentence, the prompting methods have to enumerate all n-grams token span to find all the possible slots, which greatly slows down the prediction. To tackle this, we introduce an inverse paradigm for prompting. Different from the classic prompts map tokens to labels, we reversely predict slot values given slot types. Such inverse prompting only requires a one-turn prediction for each slot type and greatly speeds up the prediction. Besides, we propose a novel Iterative Prediction Strategy, from which the model learns to refine predictions by considering the relations between different slot types. We find, somewhat surprisingly, the proposed method not only predicts faster, but also significantly improves the effect (improve over 6.1 F1-scores on 10-shot setting) and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.",Anonymous,/forum?id=XKEFSwYUewV,,,,,
771,dPyE06n12yX,Fair comparison of knowledge graphs for question answering,,,,,/pdf?id=dPyE06n12yX,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Knowledge graphs are commonly used as sources of information in question answering. Models often combine pre-trained text encoders with a graph encoder to use this information to increase accuracy. However, the way that these two types of model interact is not clear. Here we show that, when provided with graph information for a random question, two recent models exhibit no significant change in performance. These models cannot therefore be used to obtain graph-structured explanations, or to compare the relevance of a particular knowledge graph to a dataset. We perform two model ablations and show that the resulting model is more responsive to variation in graph input, and so can be used for gathering explanations and measuring KG-dataset fit. We also show that uncontrollable nondeterminism can cause significant changes in results, and highlight the importance of statistical testing of these models.",Anonymous,/forum?id=dPyE06n12yX,,,,,

773,YRia3RRZHXm,Incorporating Dual-Aware with Hierarchical Interactive Memory Networks for Task-Oriented Dialogue,,,,,/pdf?id=YRia3RRZHXm,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Recent years, end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems have made a remarkable breakthrough. However, existing dialogue models tend to equally summarize all the history as the context representation and apply memory networks to incorporate external knowledge. They neglect to highlight the latest request of users, which will cause the unexpected responses to be generated. In addition, it is insufficient for the original memory networks to interact between memories only at hop-level and difficult to extract more useful knowledge information. To address this issue, we propose a novel neural model which incorporates Dual-Aware with Hierarchical Interactive Memory Networks (DA-HIMN). The dual-aware constituting static request-aware and dynamic KB-aware is responsible for capturing the latest request of users and collecting related knowledge information. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical interaction mechanism to augment the memory networks at layer-level to more adequately learn the knowledge representation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baseline model on two task-oriented dialogue datasets in several evaluation metrics.",Anonymous,/forum?id=YRia3RRZHXm,,,,,

Most of existing DA techniques in NLP naively add a certain number of augmented samples without paying attention to the quality and added computational cost of these samples. Furthermore, state-of-the-art DA techniques in the literature usually learn to generate or re-weight augmented samples more specific to the main task; however, these learning-based DA techniques are not sample-efficient and they are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a universal DA technique, called Glitter, for NLP which aims at efficiency and performance at the same time. In other words, Glitter can be applied to any existing DA technique to improve its training efficiency and sample efficiency and maintain its competitive performance. We evaluate Glitter on several downstream tasks such as the GLUE benchmark, SQuAD, and HellaSwag in a variety of scenarios including general single network, consistency training, self-distillation and knowledge distillation (KD) setups.",Anonymous,/forum?id=3Rfj-IdJ-s,,,,,

776,NThz_6MqDuG,Word2Box: Capturing Set-Theoretic Semantics of Words using BoxEmbeddings,,,,,/pdf?id=NThz_6MqDuG,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Learning representations of words in a continuous space is perhaps the most fundamental task in NLP, a prerequisite for nearly all modern machine-learning techniques. Often the objective is to capture distributional similarity via vector dot product, however this is just one relation between word meanings we may wish to capture. It is natural to consider words as (soft) equivalence classes based on similarity, it is natural to expect the ability to perform set-theoretic operations (intersection, union, difference) on these representations. This is particularly relevant for words which are homographs- for example, “tongue”∩“body” should be similar to “mouth”, while “tongue”∩“language” should be similar to “dialect”. Box embeddings are a novel region-based representation which provide the capability to perform these set-theoretic operations. In this work, we provide a fuzzy-set interpretation of box embeddings, and train box embeddings with a CBOW objective where contexts are represented using intersection. We demonstrate improved performance on various word similarity tasks, particularly on less common words, and perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis exploring the additional unique expressivity provided by Word2Box.",Anonymous,/forum?id=NThz_6MqDuG,,/attachment?id=NThz_6MqDuG&name=software,,,

In this paper, we further conduct a thorough robustness evaluation of cutting-edge GEC methods to four different types of adversarial attacks and propose a simple yet very effective Cycle Self-Augmenting (CSA) method accordingly. By leveraging the augmenting data from the GEC models themselves in the post-training process and introducing regularization data for cycle training, our proposed method can effectively improve model robustness of well-trained GEC models with only a few more training epochs as the extra cost. Experiments on four benchmark datasets and seven strong models indicate that our proposed training method can significantly enhance the robustness to four types of attacks without using purposely built adversarial examples in training. Evaluation results on clean data further confirm that our proposed CSA method significantly improves the performance of four baselines and yields nearly comparable results with other state-of-the-art models.

This work proposes a novel \emph{self-distillation} based pruning strategy, whereby the representational similarity between the pruned and unpruned versions of the same network is maximized. Unlike previous approaches that treat distillation and pruning separately, we use distillation to inform the pruning criteria, without requiring a separate student network as in knowledge distillation. We show that the proposed {\em cross-correlation objective for self-distilled pruning} implicitly encourages sparse solutions, naturally complementing magnitude-based pruning criteria. Experiments on the GLUE and XGLUE benchmarks show that self-distilled pruning increases mono- and cross-lingual language model performance. Self-distilled pruned models also outperform smaller Transformers with an equal number of parameters and are competitive against (6 times) larger distilled networks. We also observe that self-distillation (1) maximizes class separability, (2) increases the signal-to-noise ratio, and (3) converges faster after pruning steps, providing further insights into why self-distilled pruning improves generalization.",Anonymous,/forum?id=j52eftbZyQj,,,,,

An Extensive Empirical Study on Language Tasks,,,,,/pdf?id=AwY-3YBTBs0,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There have been a lot of interest in the scaling properties of Transformer models. However, not much has been done on the front of investigating the effect of scaling properties of different inductive biases and model architectures. Do model architectures scale differently? If so, how does inductive bias affect scaling behaviour? How does this influence upstream (pretraining) and downstream (transfer)? This paper conducts a systematic study of scaling behaviour of ten diverse model architectures such as Transformers, Switch Transformers, Universal Transformers, Dynamic convolutions, Performers, and recently proposed MLP-Mixers. Via extensive experiments, we show that (1) architecture is an indeed an important consideration when performing scaling and (2) the best performing model can fluctuate at different scales. We believe that the findings outlined in this work has significant implications to how model architectures are currently evaluated in the community.",Anonymous,/forum?id=AwY-3YBTBs0,,,,/forum?id=Wrtp36cbl61,

The proposed method utilizes multi-task learning to integrate four self-supervised and supervised subtasks for cross modality learning. A self-supervised speech subtask, which leverages unlabelled speech data, and a (self-)supervised text to text subtask, which makes use of abundant text training data, take up the majority of the pre-training time. Two auxiliary supervised speech tasks are included to unify speech and text modeling space. Detailed analysis reveals learning interference among subtasks. In order to alleviate the subtask interference, two pre-training configurations are proposed for speech translation and speech recognition respectively. Our experiments show the proposed method can effectively fuse speech and text information into one model. It achieves between 1.7 and 2.3 BLEU improvement above the state of the art on the MuST-C speech translation dataset and comparable WERs to wav2vec 2.0 on the Librispeech speech recognition task.",Anonymous,/forum?id=lE6T0rKl5Jg,,,,,
